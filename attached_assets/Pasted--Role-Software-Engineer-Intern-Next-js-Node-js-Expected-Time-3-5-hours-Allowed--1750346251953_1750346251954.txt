**Role:** Software Engineer Intern (Next.js / Node.js)

**Expected Time:** 3–5 hours

**Allowed Tools:** AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot), documentation, Stack Overflow — **just be transparent about what was AI-assisted.**

**Goal:** We want to see how you think, learn, and ship. Treat this like a real product challenge at AppEasy.

### ⚙️ Scenario

AppEasy helps users automatically apply for jobs, track their application progress, and improve their resumes using AI.

We want you to build a **Mini Job Tracker** web app — similar to a stripped-down version of one AppEasy feature.

---

### ✅ Your Challenge

Build a full-stack app with the following features:

### 🧭 Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)

- A form to **add a job application**, including:
    - Job Title
    - Company Name
    - Application Link
    - Status (e.g., Applied, Interviewing, Rejected, Offer)
- A dashboard that shows the list of added job applications in a table
- Ability to **edit** or **delete** a job entry

### 🧰 Backend (Node.js or API Routes in Next.js)

- Store all job applications in-memory or a simple local JSON file (no database required)
- Expose RESTful endpoints:
    - `GET /jobs`
    - `POST /jobs`
    - `PUT /jobs/:id`
    - `DELETE /jobs/:id`

### 🤖 AI Bonus (Encouraged)

- Add a feature that lets the user **paste a job description** and click “Analyze”
- Use **OpenAI (or ChatGPT)** to:
    - Return a summary of the job
    - Suggest 3 skills the user should highlight in their resume

You can use any OpenAI model (or even paste your prompt + result manually if you don’t have an API key).
